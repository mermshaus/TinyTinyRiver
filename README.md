# TinyTinyRiver

A river of news style front-end for [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/).

## Setup

1. Run the following commands:

    ~~~ bash
    git clone https://github.com/mermshaus/TinyTinyRiver.git
    cd TinyTinyRiver
    cp config.dist.php config.php
    ~~~

2. Edit `config.php` and navigate to the `public` directory with a browser.

As of now, Tiny Tiny River doesnâ€™t perform any write operations through the tt-rss API. The front-end is read-only.
